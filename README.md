## Features

### Toolbar Creation & Customization:

    - The ReadEasy class dynamically creates a toolbar, which can include features like a URL input field, magnification options, and text-to-speech controls.
    - The toolbar can be customized using the options object passed during instantiation. Options include:
        - show_url_field: Whether to display a URL input field.
        - show_magnifying_glass: Whether to display a magnifying glass for text magnification.
        - show_text_to_speech: Whether to display the text-to-speech button.

### Magnification:

    - The toolbar includes an option to magnify text by a factor (e.g., 1.2x, 1.3x, etc.).
    - Magnification can be applied to both images and text within the content. The magnified content will also be styled with a custom font and background color, which can be modified via the toolbar.
    - Magnification can be toggled on/off using the magnifying glass button.

### Text-to-Speech:

    - The text-to-speech feature allows the user to listen to the selected text on the page.
    - The user can choose between different voices (e.g., US English Male, UK English Female).
    - The text-to-speech functionality is triggered when the user selects text on the page. This behavior can be toggled on and off via the toolbar button.
    
### Content Fetching:

    - The fetchURL function allows fetching external content (e.g., web pages) and displaying them in the specified content container, typically a <div> or <iframe>.
    - This functionality is powered by a proxy server (configured via the proxyUrl).

### ResponsiveVoice Integration:

    - If the responsiveVoice library is available, the class uses it to speak the selected text or provide feedback (e.g., "Magnification activated").
    - The voice selection can be customized via the toolbar.

## Existing Features 

### Toolbar Creation:

**Dynamic Toolbar:** The ReadEasy class creates a customizable toolbar that can include multiple features like URL input, magnification controls, and text-to-speech buttons.

**Customization:** The toolbar is customizable based on the options provided during instantiation, such as enabling or disabling the URL field, magnifying glass, and text-to-speech functionality.

### Magnification:

**Text Magnification:** Users can magnify text by hovering over it. The class supports magnification of text by scaling font size dynamically based on a specified magnification factor (e.g., 1.2x, 1.3x, etc.).

**Image Magnification:** Images within the content can also be magnified when the mouse hovers over them.

**Magnification Customization:** Users can adjust the magnification settings, such as:
    - Magnification factor (e.g., 1.2x, 1.3x, 1.5x, 2x).
    - Magnification font color.
    - Magnification background color.

### Text-to-Speech:

**Read Aloud Selected Text:** The class allows users to select text from the content, and it will be read aloud using text-to-speech functionality.

**Voice Selection:** Users can choose from multiple available voices (e.g., "US English Male," "US English Female," etc.).
Toggle Text-to-Speech: Users can enable or disable text-to-speech via a button in the toolbar. When activated, the selected text on the page will be read aloud, and the button will change to reflect the current state.

**ResponsiveVoice Integration:** The class uses the responsiveVoice library for text-to-speech functionality (if available). It allows for voice selection and speaking the selected text.

### URL Input Field:

**Fetch URL:** The toolbar includes an input field where users can enter a URL. When a URL is entered and the user presses "Enter" or the field loses focus, the page content is fetched and displayed in the content container.

**URL Navigation:** The class also intercepts anchor clicks within the content, preventing the default browser navigation. Instead, the content is fetched from the clicked URL and displayed within the content container.

### Event Listeners:

**URL Field:** Event listeners are added to the URL input field to fetch and display content from the entered URL when the user presses "Enter" or leaves the field.

**Anchor Clicks:** The class intercepts anchor link clicks within the content to fetch new content dynamically, instead of following the link.

**Magnifying Glass:** A magnifying glass icon in the toolbar can be clicked to toggle magnification on and off. When enabled, users can hover over content to magnify text and images.

**Text Selection for Text-to-Speech:** When text-to-speech is enabled, the class listens for text selection events (e.g., mouseup and touchend) in the content area to read the selected text aloud.

### Content Fetching:

**Fetch and Display Content:** The fetchURL function fetches content from a given URL using a proxy server and updates the content container (which could be a div or an iframe).

**Cross-Origin Request Handling:** The content is fetched through a proxy server < https://readeasy-b281a909ec0b.herokuapp.com/proxy > to avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues.

### Responsive Voice Feedback:

**Voice Feedback:** The ReadEasy class can provide voice feedback for actions, such as when magnification is activated or deactivated, or when text-to-speech is toggled on or off.

### Content-Type Handling:

**Iframe Support:** If the content is displayed in an iframe, the class ensures that the magnification and text-to-speech functionality work inside the iframe as well. It handles text selection and mouse events within the iframeâ€™s document.
General Content Handling: The class works with both content inside iframes and directly displayed content (e.g., a div), making it versatile for different content types.


## Features Left to Implement

## Design

![Color Palette](/assets/images/color-palette-readease.jpg)

    - the palette was chosen due to certain color combinations can significantly improve readability for people with dyslexia.
    - the **soft contrast** between text and background is less straining on the eyes, and avoiding stark combinations like black-on-white or white-on-black.
    - the contrast between text and the background ensures readability without causing visual discomfort.
    - some studies suggest that certain colors, such as blue or yellow, can help reduce visual stress and improve reading speed and accuracy. 

![Font] - Lexend

    - In addition to color, using clear, sans-serif fonts like Arial or Verdana, and ensuring proper spacing between lines and letters can also enhance readability.
    - The Lexend font is a font designed for people with dyslexia and struggling readers.
    - If the font does not load, the back-up font is sans-serif.
